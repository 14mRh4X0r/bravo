I'd like to say that this is a hard post for me to write, but to be honest,
it's been quite easy, so I'm gonna just say it:

**Bravo is officially on hiatus. No features will be added, nor bugs fixed,
without either patch or cash.**

Why? Well, Minecraft's final version came out. It's horribly buggy, looks bad,
is very laggy, and has not really improved the user experience. I stopped
playing recreationally in February, and really haven't missed any part of the
game at all. Minecraft isn't fun, and the novelty wore off over a year ago.

Nobody else contributes to Bravo. I don't mean to marginalize the other
committers, all of whom are highly valued and have worked hard, but let's
throw down some numbers: I have committed 1910 times to Bravo. The next
committer has 39 commits. I've written 88% of this thing. It's not really a
team effort when one guy is doing all of the driving. Bravo can't continue
with the other 12% alone, especially when most of them drove by, added a
patch, and then took off again.

I've gotten zero donations for Bravo. When every other open-source project in
the Minecraft world, and quite a few non-open-source projects, get donations,
it's kind of disheartening to not get any cash, but more importantly, Bravo
represents a significant time sink, and I can't afford to continue dedicating
time to Bravo when I have other things I could be doing.

Here's what Bravo has accomplished in the past 13 months:

 * March 2011: Helped implement Numpy in PyPy_.
 * April 20, 2011: First big adopter of Exocet_.
 * May 8, 2011: First big adopter of wok_.

Additionally, I've become a big supporter of, and occasional contributor to,
Twisted_, which I consider to be very important in the Python ecosystem.

And, of course, nearly 30,000 lines of code, documentation, and supporting
materials were written, not counting the contributions to the `Minecraft
Coalition`_.

It's been a fun ride. ~ C.
