Welcome to Bravo 1.6! Lots of things have changed, but most of them aren't
very obvious; this release is very much about incremental improvement rather
than big features. As usual, the changelog might be a good thing to read
through. A handful of new plugins (grass, fertilizer, doors) dominate the
diffstat, as well as some old ones (trees, water) which have been rewritten to
suck less.
