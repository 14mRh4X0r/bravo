Thank you for your patience! I know that it's been a rough half-day waiting
for Bravo to acquire support for the newest Minecraft Beta release, and there
were some tough times. Many of you were wondering where I was, and why I was
slacking off and doing things like eating, sleeping, and taking midterm exams,
rather than writing code. Well, I have good news for you all.

Preliminary protocol 13 support has been pushed to the main repository. This
means that, when running from git, Beta 1.6 clients are now supported. In
addition, several bugs for Bravo 1.7 have been opened, targeting the new
features of Beta 1.6, like long grass, maps, and Nether support. Not all of
the new features are going to make it into Bravo, though; for example, the
100% CPU usage of the new Notchian server isn't likely to be replicated in
Bravo, for technical reasons.

If you are one of the brave souls testing the git repository, feel free to
give us feedback on whether or not things work. If you aren't using git, why
not give it a whirl? There are tarballs and zipballs located on the
`Github download page
<https://github.com/MostAwesomeDude/bravo/archives/master>`_ which are
ready-to-go.
