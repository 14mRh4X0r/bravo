What the title says, guys. Sorry. The basic reasoning is as follows: It's
Sunday night, a few hours before the deadline, and there are still iffy kinks
in the newly-rewritten automaton subsystem which are not exactly
confidence-inspiring in my eyes. Additionally, only about half of our target
bugs have gotten handled since 1.5, and overall I'm just not happy with the
current state of the tree. This release is definitely not very big compared to
1.5; most of the features are architectural and relate to cleanup and
organization. This is, at best, a maintenance release which bumps the minor
version number by coincidence.

Now that I've said all that, I'm still aiming for Wednesday for a release. I'm
taking solace in the fact that I'm **still** going to be releasing before the
next Notchian Beta release, so there's a silver lining to this cloud.

Speaking of clouds, I noticed nobody has requested weather support. Is this
just not something that people want?
