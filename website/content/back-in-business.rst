Hey, all! It's been a while. I hope you're all doing well.

Remember Bravo? The little server that could? It's back. Or, rather, the
development team is back. Along with a couple friends, I'm going back to work
on Bravo, and Bravo 2.0 will be along soon, with a cleaned-up plugin system,
Minecraft 1.4 compatibility, and a whole chockload of bugfixes and features.

Oh, and we gained PyPy compatibility, making us faster than ever. In
preliminary benchmarks, Bravo runs **sixty times faster** on PyPy than on
CPython, and you can expect dramatic speedups when using this configuration.
We'll be sure to tell you more about it later.

Thanks to the community for welcoming us back so openly. We missed you too.

~ C. and the Bravo Team
