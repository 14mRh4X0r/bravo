http://docs.bravoserver.org/ now has a copy of the latest documentation from
Bravo, and will get updated whenever the code is updated. Rejoice as
appropriate.

There are a couple important things in the documentation that have been
recently added. In particular, there is now an `administration guide for new
server administrators <http://docs.bravoserver.org/administration.html>`_ which
hopefully will be useful to people.
